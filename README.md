# Muon-detector-model

Describes a model to process the data from arbitrary rectangular muon detector and fit it. (documentation included).
It can also simulate the muon flux through an arbitrary rectangular 3D body (in the case of this code a 1x1x0.0005 cm chip is used as an example).

## Attention! - check the pdf for a complete and concise model explanation (with nice images)
